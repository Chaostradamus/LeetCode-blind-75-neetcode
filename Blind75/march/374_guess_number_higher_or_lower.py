# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

# Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

# You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

# -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
# 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
# 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
# Return the number that I picked.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: n = 10, pick = 6
# Output: 6
# Example 2:

# Input: n = 1, pick = 1
# Output: 1
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 2, pick = 1
# Output: 1
