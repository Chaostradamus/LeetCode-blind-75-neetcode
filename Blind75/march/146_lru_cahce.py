# idea is to have hashmao with key value where key is key but value is pointer to reference in doublely linked list
# hashmap holds reference and double linked list will hold the nodes from left to right from least to most recent
# dummy nodes on far left and right to hold positions 
# to insert we will insert at far right

# create node class with key value and no prev or next
# cache initializes size and creates the hashmap and dummy nodes pointing to each other because initially empty linked list
# get function checks forkey in cache and then removes it and reinserts it so its moved up in the cache else we return a false
# to put something in we first check for it in cache and remove
#   if not in it itll set a new node reference for cache[key] 
#   then it will insert it into the linked list 

# the remove function will remove from the doublly linked list. we just reset some pointers
#   set pointers at nodes. prev and next
#   then we point from the pointers to each other to delete node

# to insert we insert to the right since its the most recently cached
# we set pointers on dummy nodes previous and next to itself
# we insert node by setting previous.next to node and next.prev to node also
# then we set nodes next and prev to nxt and prev pointers from the beginning



# 46. LRU Cache
# Solved

# Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

# Implement the LRUCache class:

# LRUCache(int capacity) Initialize the LRU cache with positive size capacity.
# int get(int key) Return the value of the key if the key exists, otherwise return -1.
# void put(int key, int value) Update the value of the key if the key exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.
# The functions get and put must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

 

# Example 1:

# Input
# ["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
# [[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
# Output
# [null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

# Explanation
# LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
# lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
# lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
# lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
# lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
# lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
# lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
# lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
# lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
# lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
