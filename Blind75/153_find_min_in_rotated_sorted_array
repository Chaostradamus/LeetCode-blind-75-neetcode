# Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

# [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
# [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
# Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

# Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
# Example 3:

# Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
# Output: 11
# Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 

# o(logn) time and o(1) space
# set l and right pointers
# while nums.left is less than nums.right
# if nums.left is less than nums.right than take min of left and result and return
# this is because itll be the smallest in the sorted split
# set mid pointer
# take min of res and mid.val
# if mid.val is greater thn left.val then reset left to be mid+1...moves pointer to search the other sorted array
# otherwise set right to mid - 1 to search the other sorted array
# binary search on array that is sorted
